# Approov Token Binding Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with Ruby who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov with token binding to an existing Ruby API server.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [README](/README.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product.html) for more details.

## How it works?

For more background, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repository.

The main functionality for the Approov token binding check is in the file [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.rb](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello-server-protected.rb). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` and `verifyApproovTokenBinding()` functions to see the simple code for the checks.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the Ruby and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* Ruby - Follow the official installation instructions from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the Ruby API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the Ruby API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box executing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the Ruby API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```text
approov secret /path/to/approov/administration.tok -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an administration management token to execute successfully. Developer management tokens don't have sufficient privileges to get the secret.

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [jwt/ruby-jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt) package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

Add this functions to your code:

```ruby
require 'dotenv'
require 'jwt'
require 'base64'
require 'digest'

env = Dotenv.parse(".env")

if not env['HTTP_PORT']
    env['HTTP_PORTP'] = 8002
end

if not env['SERVER_HOSTNAME']
    env['SERVER_HOSTNAME'] = '127.0.0.1'
end

if not env['APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET']
    raise "Missing in the .env file the value for the variable: APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET"
end

APPROOV_SECRET = Base64.decode64(env['APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET'])

def verifyApproovToken headers
    begin
        approov_token = headers['approov-token']

        if not approov_token
            # You may want to add some logging here
            return nil
        end

        options = { algorithm: 'HS256' }
        approov_token_claims, header = JWT.decode approov_token, APPROOV_SECRET, true, options

        return approov_token_claims
    rescue JWT::DecodeError => e
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return nil
    rescue JWT::ExpiredSignature => e
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return nil
    rescue JWT::InvalidIssuerError => e
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return nil
    rescue JWT::InvalidIatError
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return nil
    end

    # You may want to add some logging here
    return nil
end

def verifyApproovTokenBinding headers, approov_token_claims
    # Note that the `pay` claim will, under normal circumstances, be present,
    # but if the Approov failover system is enabled, then no claim will be
    # present, and in this case you want to return true, otherwise you will not
    # be able to benefit from the redundancy afforded by the failover system.
    if not approov_token_claims['pay']
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return true
    end

    # We use the Authorization token, but feel free to use another header in
    # the request. Beqar in mind that it needs to be the same header used in the
    # mobile app to qbind the request with the Approov token.
    token_binding_header = headers['authorization']

    if not token_binding_header
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return false
    end

    # We need to hash and base64 encode the token binding header, because that's
    # how it was included in the Approov token on the mobile app.
    token_binding_header_encoded = Digest::SHA256.base64digest token_binding_header

    if not approov_token_claims['pay'] === token_binding_header_encoded
        # You may want to add some logging here
        return false
    end

    return true
end
```

Now you just need to invoke it from the endpoint you want to protected:

```ruby
if not approov_token_claims = verifyApproovToken(headers)
    sendResponse(connection, 401, JSON.generate({}))
    next
end

if not verifyApproovTokenBinding(headers, approov_token_claims)
    sendResponse(connection, 401, JSON.generate({}))
    next
end
```

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```
approov token -setDataHashInToken 'Bearer authorizationtoken' -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

##### No Authorization Token

Let's just remove the Authorization header from the request:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401

...

{}
```

##### Same Approov Token with a Different Authorization Token

Make the request with the same generated token, but with another random authorization token:

```
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer anotherauthorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should also fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401

...

{}
```
